The files included within this folder have been used to visualize the data outputted from FLEX

Please note that while these files are provided, the plotting completed within these is largely edited through commenting out the undesired code to allow for various figures to be re-created. My suggestion for the use of these functions would be to create a copy of these functions and tailor the figures to your desired output parameters. These files however are very useful to better understand the use of the OUTPUT data from FLEX.

To use GustResponsePLotting.m specify the location of the saved workspace that are outputted following running Flight_dynamics.m

Save_Plot is used through the command window. Calling this function will save the outputted/specified figure # as a PDF, ideal for use within LATEX
