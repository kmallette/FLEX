**Welcome to FLEX 1.0**

FLEX is a derivative of VAPs with focussed goal of evaluating flexible aircraft within a turbulent atmosphere. For a more complete overview of the program please see the readme file within the main VAPS directory. This program is further explained within each sub-folder within this directory. 

To get yourself oriented please find FLEX > Run Files. This subfolder contains multiple run files named "Flight_Dyanmics". To begin please checkout "Flight_Dynamics_Georgina" as this is the most current, and utilized run file. If you want to create your own run simply create a copy of this file and edit the input file that is being called on line 9.

For a verification of the work completed or an outline of the work that has been completed using this program please look into the two publications below.
